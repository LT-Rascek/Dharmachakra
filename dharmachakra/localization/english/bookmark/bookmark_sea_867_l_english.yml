  bm_867_sea_india_desc:0 "Since the end of the Varman dynasty in 770 CE, the rich lands of Kannauj, or Kanyakubja, have been a hotly contested prize among the kingdoms of India. Though control of the city passed in turn between the Pratihara, Pala, and Rashtrakuta dynasties, ultimately Nahabhata Pratihara succeeded in fending off the others, making Kanyakubja the crown jewel of the Pratihara state.\n\n#bold But while the battle has ended, the kingdoms of Pala and Rashtrakuta still stand, and the tide may yet turn. Any one of these rulers could retake Kanyakubja, and from there become master of all land lying between the two seas. Which will you be?#!"

  bm_867_sea_tibet_desc:0 "The Tibetan Empire has fallen into chaos. Tsenpo Langdarma was assassinated in 842, splitting the plateau between his two sons, Ösung and Yumten. While the fate of the realm hangs in the balance, other kingdoms see opportunity.\n\n#bold Is Tibet shattered once and for all? Or will it be reunited under a new emperor? #!"

Situated in the Tarim Basin, it occupies a crucial stretch of the Silk Road between the nomadic tribes of the north, Tibet and India to the south, and the Islamic emirates in the west.\n\n#bold Will you help Shah Vijaya Vikarma II lead his people through a new era of independence and prosperity, or will the kingdom fall to ruin? #!"

  bookmark_sea_tibet_guge_desc:0 "Unlike his supposed brother Yumten, the legitimacy of Ösung's birth is not in question. This may not be enough, however, to maintain control over the western regions of the Tibetan Plateau. Though firmly seated in the kingdom of Guge, the rest of Tibet may soon escape Ösung's grasp.\n\nWill you aid Ösung in taking back his birthright, or is the fragmentation of Tibet all but inevitable?"

  bookmark_sea_tibet_u_desc:0 "Despite much contention over whether Yumten is truly a legitimate son of Tsenpo Langdarma, he has nonetheless managed to gather support from the lords in the central Ü region of Tibet. His position is, however, precarious at best. The eastern regions long for independence, and it will take skillful maneuvering to avoid utter collapse, let alone the reunification of Tibet.\n\nWill you overcome the odds and bring peace to the plateau? Or has the empire truly come to an end?"
