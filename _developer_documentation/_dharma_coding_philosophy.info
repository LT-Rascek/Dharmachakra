Coding Philosophy Notes:

0). Above all else, code that works is better than code that doesn't or code that's pretty!

1). Whenever possible, write code to a separate file instead of overwriting Vanilla

    Reason: Keeps code base fairly harmonized whenever vanilla updates

2). Make Vanilla overwrites sparse
    a). If needing to only overwrite some components, create a new file <fname>_dharma_overwrite.txt
        i). Avoids needless Vanilla inclusion and makes maintenance easier
    b). If the file is only fixing some issue that is likely caused by PDX, create a new file <fname>_dharma_vanilla_fix.txt
        i). Makes it clear what should be reviewed after PDX patches
    b). If Vanilla files must be overwritten (e.g., removal), try to keep meticulous records of what was changed
        i). Makes maintenance easier if we have explanations as to why changes were need
    d). Add reasons and file to the _BP_hard_file_overwrites.info for better file tracking

3). CK3 scripting supports quasi-templating like code via $NAME$ semantics, where $NAME$ is replaced inline [1]. Use that to reduce code duplication.

    Reason: Code duplication leads to the risk of some blocks of code being missed and makes maintenance harder

4). Place as many references as possible in common/scripted_effects/ and common/scripted_triggers/ instead of in actionable folders like common/decisions/ or common/laws/

    Reason: Prevents having code spread out across files for ease of maintenance

5). Use script value references in localization whenever possible.
    a). Example: "[EmptyScope.ScriptValue('the_script_value')]"

    Reason: This makes the localization always up-to-date as we tweak various values in the mod.

Examples

[1] Pseudo-code example make_feudal.txt:

if = {
	limit = { this.tier >= tier_barony }
	do_thing = { NAME = this }
}

common/scripted_effects/effects.txt:
	do_thing = {
		$NAME$.holder = { change_government = feudal_government }
	}
