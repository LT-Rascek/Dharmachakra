# Dharmachakra for CK3

## Latest Version: 1.1.0 "Saraswati" (Released 15/10/2020)

Dharmachakra is a flavor mod for CK3 focused on the Indian Subcontient and the neighboring regions of Burma and Tibet, as well as the Dharmic Religions of Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism and religions influenced by them.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Changelog

- Added the cultures of Malayali, Konkani, Saurashtra, Braj, awadhi, Malvi, Gondi, Nagpuri, Bihari, Bhil, Rajbongshi, Kachari, Chin, Rakhine
- Hindustani is now a melting pot culture. It will happen in the late medieval era, if you are of Iranian or Turkic culture and you rule over Braj or Awadhi


## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is the WIP version that is constantly being updated!

1. Go to <https://github.com/herkles/Dharmachakra/releases> and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select Dharmachakra in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

NOTE: If you are re-installing a mod, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues.
